# Project Description

A raw dataset with train and test files provided to predict housing prices. We will do model building in future phases. Currently the goal is to demonstrate how to do comprehensive EDA, Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering applicable to any use case.

# Goal

1.) EDA

2.) Data Cleaning (Dealing with missing values, handling outliers, gaussain transformation, categorical variable encoding, scaling and normalization)

3.) Feature Selection

# Files

1.) train.csv and test.csv are the raw data files provided. They are used by the EDA and Feature Engineering notebooks

2.) cleaned_train.csv and cleaned_test.csv are the clean data files obtained after Data Cleaning

3.) Model_train_data.csv and Model_test_data.csv are the resultant of the feature selection notebook and provide the data files that can be passed to ML models
